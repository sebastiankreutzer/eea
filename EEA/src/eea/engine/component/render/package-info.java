/**
 * This package provides the concrete implementation for 
 * renderable components.
 * 
 * Currently, the two following types are supported:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link eea.engine.component.render.AnimationRenderComponent} 
 * shows a succession of images at a given speed (e.g., for 
 * displaying an explosion or the movement of a body)</li>
 * 
 * <li>A {@link eea.engine.component.render.ImageRenderComponent} shows a 
 * simple component represented by an image that is adapted based
 * on the current scale and rotation values.</li>
 * </ul>
